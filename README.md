# SBPortfolio

## Description 

This one was great because it was making a page that was from scratch, although this isn't anything like a youtube toturial or following a text book, its far more interesting this way because its complete freedom and its sink or swim. I know ill definetely come back and adjust plenty of things that ive done. While this is the second of the cohort I already feel like ive learned so much more than ever before. 

## Contributors 
While it was hard to add contributors this time around because there was so many, im sure ill add them sooner than later. It was alot of classmates.
