               <p>I was a few tutorials and reading I was able to create a calculator for anyone to use. One of the projects that made me interested <br>
                In becoming a developer was this simple calculator. Understanding that you can create something from a few lines of code was great.

            <p>This was a fun quick game that I was able to find when I was introduced into JavaScript. <br>
                While this was a tutorial as well, it was something that I was able to understand and find as a stepping stone into the direction of my future career.
