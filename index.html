        <h3>Calculator</h3>
            <p>Through a few tutorials and reading I was able to create a calculator for anyone to use. One of the projects that made me interested <br>
            In becoming a developer was this simple calculator. Understanding that you can create something from a few lines of code was great.

        <!-- include a memory game with the photo, the alt tag for impared people and liinks that work for display-->
        <h3>Memory Game</h3>
        <p>This was a fun quick game that I was able to find when I was introduced into JavaScript. <br>
            While this was a tutorial as well, it was something that I was able to understand and find as a stepping stone into the direction of my future career.
