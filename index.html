            <img src="/SBPortfolio/images/nationalPark.jpeg" height="260px" width="260px" alt="animated bank photo">
            <p>This was the first project as a team that i've been part of. This was so great to get real world experience. <br>
                Having multiple people work on things was great! This project is a National Park Finder. <br>
                There is a search bar that you can enter a National Park and it will provide information using an API. <br>
                The information provided is the operations hours, the current weather, and a brief paragraph of the park and a photo.

            <img src="/SBPortfolio/images/calculator.ico" alt="a simple calculator app for everyday use">
               <p>I was a few tutorials and reading I was able to create a calculator for anyone to use. One of the projects that made me interested <br>
                In becoming a developer was this simple calculator. Understanding that you can create something from a few lines of code was great. </p>

            <img src="/SBPortfolio/images/cards.webp" alt="animated bank photo">
            <p>This was a fun quick game that I was able to find when I was introduced into JavaScript. <br>
                While this was a tutorial as well, it was something that I was able to understand and find as a stepping stone into the direction of my future career.

            <h3>Note Taker</h3>
            <img src="/SBPortfolio/images/noteimage.png" height="260px" width="260px" alt="animated bank photo">
            <p>This project was interesting because it used backend to enable the note taker to work. <br>
                Understanding Routes has been a good way to see how backend works and its very interesting.
